Ahhh, it always feels so nice to start a new project. It'll just be weird though. Theoretically, people will be able to actually read this! Not that that's any concern of mine, really, I have dev work to do. As per usual, these notes and logs are where I will describe some of my trials and tribulations developing features and things like that here.

With all this said, *man*, that Corgi Engine, huh? What a piece of work. It's a really neat system now that I'm trudging through some of the documentation and seeing what's already been made. 

Although, I'll admit, it almost feels wrong to use these assets that aren't mine and suffer through a less-featured character controller like I'm used to. However, this offers the opportunity for tremendous growth and thing ls like that! Honestly it worried me a bit that this might be very one-size-fits-all approach to developing a project like this, but I'm not sure I should be worried as much as I should be planning around that.

Essentially, if they're able to reduce some of the work that I typically do in a project-starting setting, I should be glad! Instead, I should think about how best to work with that, and what else I'll need to make.

As such, my goal for *today* is to ***create a truly basic prototype of the game implementing a Weapon, and creating an EnemyAmbushZone*** or some area where enemies spawn and and all that.

## Weapons
As it happens, weapons are feature in the Corgi Engine and can be made with the appropriate script, which is the FIRST thing I'll be working with today. They have a cute little video on how to implement them, so I'll watch it and take some notes here as per usual. 

Step one seems to be making my own little player prefab copy in the scene that I can give the component to handle a weapon.
